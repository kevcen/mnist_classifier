# MNIST classifier

Used to teach myself how to make a simple image classifier.

It includes:
- ## a pytorch approach
  - a simple dense neural net with ReLU
- ## a tensorflow approach
  - extending the simple dense neural net with convolutional layers for feature extraction
  - includes a gui to test your own drawn digits
